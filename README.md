The Steganography Analyzer is an advanced web-based solution aimed at enhancing cybersecurity by detecting hidden malware embedded through steganographic techniques in various file types. Steganography, the practice of concealing malicious payloads within seemingly benign files such as images, documents, and media, poses a significant threat to digital security. This project addresses that threat by integrating a comprehensive analysis framework capable of scrutinizing file structures, metadata, and embedded content against a curated library of known malware patterns and behavioral signatures.

The system architecture is built with a modern, scalable front-end developed using React and Next.js, ensuring an intuitive and seamless user experience. It enables users to easily upload files for detailed inspection, after which the backend performs layered analysis â€” including signature-based detection, anomaly identification, and suspicious pattern recognition. The tool delivers an Analysis Summary that presents results in a clear, actionable format, emphasizing any detected threats, indicators of compromise (IoCs), or unusual file characteristics that warrant further investigation.

Supporting both light and dark themes, the user interface is designed to accommodate diverse user preferences and enhance accessibility. The application targets a broad audience, including cybersecurity professionals, forensic analysts, IT administrators, and organizations handling sensitive data, providing them with a proactive mechanism to safeguard systems against steganography-based malware attacks.

By automating and simplifying the complex process of steganographic analysis, the Steganography Analyzer not only improves detection efficiency but also contributes to strengthening the overall cybersecurity posture of its users.

create a Steganographic image,audio,video files using hexeditor personally I'll suggest you(https://hexed.it/) this web site their are keywords( malware keywords.txt) which you can insert and the end of the file and save them in different folder when you deploy the project you can use them as test cases 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
step-1-> download the Steganography Analyzer zip file and extract the file on desktop or your personal space
step-2-> open the folder in cmd 
step-3-> install the required files(npm install)
step-4-> run command (npm run dev)
step-5-> open browser and type http://localhost:9002/
step-6-> the file which u stored earliar can be used for test cases
